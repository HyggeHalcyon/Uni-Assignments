/*
 * Language/Type: Java   
 * 
 * Write a method named kthSmallest that returns the kth smallest element value in a
 * row/column-sorted 2D square array of integers. Your method accepts two parameters: a 2D array
 * where each row and each column are arranged in sorted order, and an integer k. You may
 * assume that the arrays passed as parameters have the same dimensions. Consider the following
 * matrix:
 * 
 *  int[][] matrix = {
 *      { 1,  2,  5, 14},
 *      {11, 15, 19, 22},
 *      {12, 16, 28, 32},
 *      {20, 22, 29, 35}
 *  };
 * 
 * The matrix is not fully sorted, but notice that each row by itself is sorted, such as row 0, which
 * contains 1, 2, 5, and 14. Each column is also sorted, such as column 0, which contains 1, 11, 12,
 * and 20. Given the preceding matrix, the call of kthSmallest(matrix, 8) would return 16
 * since that is the array's 8th smallest element.
 * 
 * Assumptions: You may assume that the array's elements are properly row/column-sorted as
 * described. You may assume that the matrix is square, meaning that it has the same number of
 * rows and columns, and that each row has the same number of elements. You may assume that
 * the matrix has at least 1 row and 1 column. You may assume that the value passed for k is
 * between 1 and the number of elements in the matrix, inclusive.
