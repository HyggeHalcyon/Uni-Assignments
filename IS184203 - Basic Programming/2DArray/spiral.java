/*
 * Language/Type: Java   
 * 
 * Write a method named spiral that accepts a 2-D array of integers as a parameter and that
 * returns a 1-D array with the contents of the original 2-D array in the order they would appear if
 * visited in a "spiral" order, clockwise starting from top-left. For example, if the given 2-D array is
 * declared:
 * 
 *  int[][] matrix = {
 *      { 1,  2,  3,  4,  5},
 *      { 6,  7,  8,  9, 10},
 *      {11, 12, 13, 14, 15},
 *      {16, 17, 18, 19, 20},
 *  };
 * 
 * Then the call of spiral(matrix) should return the following 1-D array:
 * 
 *  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 13, 12}
 * 
 * You may assume that the 2-D array is rectangular, that is, that each row of the 2-D array contains
 * the same number of columns. You may also assume that the 2-D array contains at least one row
 * and column. Your method should not modify the array that is passed in.
